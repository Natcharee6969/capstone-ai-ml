# Capstone Project
## 📌 Project Summary
📌 Project Summary

This capstone project explores a black-box optimisation (BBO) challenge, where the internal structure of the objective functions is unknown. The goal is to iteratively propose query points that improve performance based only on observed outputs, similar to real-world optimisation problems where models or systems cannot be directly inspected.

Across multiple rounds, I developed and refined a strategy for exploring and exploiting the search space, using patterns in historical query results to guide future decisions. The project emphasises transparency, reproducibility, and responsible AI practices through clear documentation of data usage, assumptions, and limitations.

## Transparency & Documentation

This repository includes formal documentation to support transparency, reproducibility, and responsible AI practices for the BBO capstone project.

- 📄 **Dataset Datasheet**: [docs/datasheet.md](docs/datasheet.md)  
  Documents the motivation, composition, collection process, intended uses, and maintenance of the optimisation query dataset.

- 🧾 **Model Card**: [docs/model_card.md](docs/model_card.md)  
  Describes the black-box optimisation strategy, intended use, performance characteristics, assumptions, limitations, and ethical considerations.
